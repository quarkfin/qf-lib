        Retrieves the list of tickers included in the specified index at a given date.

        Parameters
        ----------
        universe_ticker: Ticker
            The ticker symbol representing the index or universe for which the tickers are being queried.
        date: datetime
            The date for which the tickers' universe data is requested.

        Returns
