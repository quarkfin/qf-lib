        Builds a grid out of a list of ``ChartElement``s.

        ----------
        mode
            Either PDF or Web. Determines whether the grid element is going to be rendered in a PDF or a website.
        elements
            A list of elements to be shown in the grid.
        figsize
            Determines the aspect ratio of the charts. This will only be used for charts added via ``add_chart``.
        dpi
            The dots per inch of the charts. This determines the resolution of the chart. This will only be used for

        optimise
            Whether the generated chart image size should be reduced.  This will only be used for
